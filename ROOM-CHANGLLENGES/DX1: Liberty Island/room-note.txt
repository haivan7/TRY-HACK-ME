Brother,

I've set up VNC on this machine under jacobson's account. We don't know his loyalty, but should assume hostile.
Problem is he's good - no doubt he'll find it... a hasty defense, but since we won't be here long, it should work.

The VNC login is the following message, 'smashthestate', hmac'ed with my username from the 'bad actors' list (lol).
Use md5 for the hmac hashing algo. The first 8 characters of the final hash is the VNC password. - JL
